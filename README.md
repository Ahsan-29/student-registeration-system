# Student Biodata Android App

In our android we will using retrofit that helps to connect our andorid app with a backend for this if we are using andorid device attached with our pc
we have to write a command on a laravel terminal (i-e php artisan serv --host="pc ip-address"  --port=3306) then on hitting it our server starts along with ipaddress with mysql port number.

Important to know if more than one server running we have to terminate that server too then working on new server other ip-address will become busy and no more api will work on android app.

Then with the help of retrofit andd some apis our android app will perform operation.
